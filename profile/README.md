  * **Surgical Precision Aimbot (Adaptive & Ballistic Smart):** Command every shot with devastating accuracy, transforming any weapon into a precision instrument.
      * **Humanized Aiming:** Adjustable smoothness, customizable FOV (Field of View), and intelligent aim movement mimic natural player actions, ensuring your shots look legitimate and evade statistical detection by EXENS.
      * **Bone Priority:** Configure targeting to specific body parts (e.g., head for instant kills, chest for consistent damage) to optimize your engagements.
      * **Advanced Bullet Prediction:** Accurately lead moving targets and compensate for realistic bullet drop and travel time, guaranteeing hits even at extreme long ranges across the vast Zone.
  * **Integrated Zero Recoil & Perfect Spread Control:** Eliminate all weapon kickback and bullet deviation for every firearm.

  * **Silent Aim:** Hit targets even when your crosshair isn't perfectly on them. This incredibly subtle feature ensures your bullets connect in chaotic moments, maintaining a legitimate appearance for ultimate stealth.
  * **Triggerbot (Auto-Fire Precision):** Automatically fire your weapon the instant an enemy enters your crosshair. Perfect for quick reactions in close quarters or precise sniping, ensuring you never miss a crucial peek.
  * **Stamina-Independent Aiming:** Maintain perfect aim stability regardless of your character's stamina level or movement, eliminating the need to rest or go prone to steady your shots.
  * **Customizable Hotkeys & Profiles:** Tailor every feature to your playstyle, switching between "Legit Aim" for competitive play and "Ragebot" for pure mayhem (PvE/unranked) with instant hotkeys. Create and save multiple configurations for different weapons or combat scenarios.

**Safety Tips:**
Even with the most advanced, undetected tools, intelligent usage is paramount for long-term account security.

  * **Disable VPN:** Some anti-cheat systems may flag VPN usage, potentially causing false positives. Ensure it's off while gaming.
  * **Temporarily Disable Antivirus/Firewall:** Your security software might mistakenly interfere with the aimbot. Whitelist its folder or temporarily disable it during use.
  * **Keep Game Client Updated:** Always ensure your Stalcraft game client is updated to the absolute latest version before launching the aimbot. This ensures compatibility and reduces detection risk.
  * **Run as Administrator:** Launch `StalcraftAim.exe` with administrator privileges to ensure proper functionality and seamless injection.
  * **Whitelist Installation Folder:** Add the tool's directory to your antivirus exceptions to prevent accidental deletion or quarantining.
  * **Strategic Play & Subtlety:** While our software is covert, your *actions* are visible. Avoid blatantly obvious moves like perfectly tracking targets through walls, instant snaps to new targets, or maintaining an impossibly high headshot percentage for an entire match. Use your "smooth aim" and "humanization" features, and vary your playstyle to appear as genuine skill\!
  * **Utilize HWID Spoofing:** Given Stalcraft's permanent ban policy and future plans for hardware bans, leveraging our integrated or recommended HWID spoofing features is crucial to shield against residual hardware flags on new accounts.
